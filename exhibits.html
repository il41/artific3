						<h2>Exhibits</h2>
						<p>Here are some of some of our recent works we created for the <a
								href="https://www.explora.us/" target="_blank">Explora</a> children's science center in
							Albuquerqe, New Mexico.</p>

						<h3>overview:</h3>
						<p>As part of the EPSCoR grant for funding science education and future energy grid technology,
							we designed and created a mixed-realty interactive table for Explora's new STEM wing.</p>
						<div class="exhibit-img-div"><br> <img src="images/projects/sc1.jpg"><br><br></div>
						<!-- <div class="exhibit-img"> <img src="images/projects/sc2.jpg"></div> -->

						<p>Museum visitors can place down game pieces containing AR codes that generate cities and power
							plants.</p> <br>
						<p>Cities grow while they are powered, and their denizens give positive feedback. Each generator
							type
							interacts with weather differently, and players experiment with balancing different methods
							of
							power generation to learn about diverse and resilient power grids.</p>
						<div class="exhibit-img-div"><br> <img src="images/smart-city/smartcity-2.jpg"><br><br></div>
						<h3>proposal and learning goals:</h3>
						<p>Explora invited us to propose a collaborative and engaging exhibit for teen audiences for
							their new STEM wing in the museum.</p><br>
						<p>We designed our game with Explora's
							exhibits philosophy in mind, that visitors should be able to explore hands-on
							and learn from each exhibit without relying on complex explanations or walls of text. We
							utilized tactile mixed-reality interactions to keep the game approachable for all age groups
							while providing the opportunity to for people to engage with SMART concepts such as
							sustainable power sources, transactive power grids, and future battery technology to
							mitigate blackouts.</p>
						<div class="exhibit-img-div"><br> <img src="images/smart-city/smartcity-7.jpg"><br><br></div>
						<!-- <div class="exhibit-img-div"><br> <img src="images/projects/sc5.jpg"><br><br></div> -->
						<p>One of our key goals was to create an experience that did not use written words to explain
							concepts in the game. We focused on only comunicating visually and sonically in order to
							keep the gameplay organized and appealing for all age groups. </p><br>
						<p>We were excited to be able to conduct several feedback workshops with the museum's teen
							interns during the conceptual phase of the project. This allowed us to take the exhibit's
							gameplay and aesthetics in the direction most applicable to our target audience while still
							communicating the core learning goals of the EPSCoR SMART Grid Center.</p><br>
						<div class="exhibit-img-div"><br> <img src="images/smart-city/smartcity-9.jpg"><br><br></div>
						<h3>the technology:</h3>
						<p>The buildings projected on the table are projection-mapped to the game
							pieces, and a secondary
							projection screen shows the current weather and a 3D flythrough of the city. </p><br>
						<p>A camera mounted above is connected to a computer under the table that runs a playful
							simulation of a modular power grid that reacts to the weather and powers
							the neighborhoods of cute city-dwellers.</p><br>
						<p>The SMART City's design uses two projectors, a camera, and a computer. The table
							and cabinet we built for Explora is one possible configuration, but we intentionally
							utilized projectors (rather than screens) so that the exhibit could be easilly installed in
							new configurations in the future.</p><br>
						<p>A future version could utilize multiple projectors
							and create an immersive view of the city on large walls, or even make use of magnets to
							allow the game to be played on a wall instead of on the table. If you have any cool ideas or
							want to install a SMART City exhibit at your location, don't hesitate to <a
								href="contact.html">contact us</a>. Artific3 can make a version to suit your location's
							needs.</p><br>

						<h2 class="exhibit-title">Selfie Station - 2022</h2>
						<p>We created an augmented reality STEM careers photo booth at Explora for their new STEM wing.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>We utilized an Xbox Kinect infared sensor to track users movements and pose, and used the
							data to generate 3D costumes based on future careers.</p>
						<div class="exhibit-img-div"><br> <img src="images/projects/ss2.jpg"><br><br></div>
						<p>Visitors could visualize themselves in fully animated real-time 3D modeled costumes of
							various future STEM careers. We designed costumes for jobs including laser technician, water
							administration scientist,
							coder, solar panel technician, and others often related to other exhibits in the museum.
