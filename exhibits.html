						<h2>Exhibits</h2>
						<p>Here are some of some of our recent works we created for the <a
								href="https://www.explora.us/" target="_blank">Explora</a> children's science center in
							Albuquerqe, New Mexico.</p>

						<h2 class="exhibit-title">SMART City - 2023</h2>
						<p>As part of the EPSCoR grant for funding science education and future energy grid technology,
							we proposed and designed a mixed-realty interactive table for Explora's new STEM wing.</p>

						<p>Museum visitors can place down game pieces containing AR codes that generate cities and power
							plants.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Explora invited us to propose a collaborative and engaging experience for teen audiences, as
							part of their new STEM wing in the museum. We also wanted to keep the game approachable for
							all age groups, and not make it overly complex for younger visitors</p>

						<div class="exhibit-img-div"><br> <img src="images/projects/sc5.jpg"><br><br></div>

						<p>One of our key goals was to create an experience that used no written words to explain
							concepts in the game. We focused on only comunicating visually and sonically in order to
							keep the gameplay organized and appealing for all age groups.</p><br>
						<p>The Explora museum's philosophy was that visitors of all ages should be able to get hands on
							and explore each exhibit, without relying on complex explanations or walls of text.</p>
						<div class="exhibit-img-div"><br> <img src="images/projects/sc3.jpg"><br><br></div>
						<p>We were fortunate to be able to conduct several feedback workshops during the conceptual
							phase of the project with the museum's teen interns, and this proccess allowed us to take
							the project in the direction most applicable to our target audience.</p>

						<h2 class="exhibit-title">Selfie Station - 2022</h2>
						<p>We created an augmented reality STEM careers photo booth for Explora for their new STEM wing.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>We utilized an Xbox Kinect infared sensor to track users movements and pose, and used the
							data to generate 3D costumes based on future careers.</p>
						<div class="exhibit-img-div"><br> <img src="images/projects/ss2.jpg"><br><br></div>
						<p>Visitors could visualize themselves in fully animated real-time 3D modeled costumes of
							various future STEM careers. We designed costumes for jobs including laser technician, water administration scientist,
							coder, solar panel technician, and others often related to other exhibits in the museum.
